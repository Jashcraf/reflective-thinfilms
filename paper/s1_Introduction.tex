\subsection{Telescope Architectures}
Next-generation telescopes for astronomy will largely take two forms. The ground-based telescopes are the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs): The European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). The GSMT's employ on-axis designs, which results in a central obscuration from the secondary mirror, and rotational symmetry of the optical system. Architechtures being considered for the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are off-axis, meaning that the primary mirror is unobscured. This is more ideal for wavefront control, but can introduce more polarization aberration due to the higher angle of incidence. To analyze the polarization aberrations of these systems, we design two "prototype" designs to approximate the polarization aberrations of a ground-based 30 meter on-axis telescope, and a space-based 6 meter off-axis telescope.
